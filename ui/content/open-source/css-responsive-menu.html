<h4>What is it?</h4>
<div class="row">
    <div class="six columns">
        A responsive navigation menu written in CSS, no JavaScript used. The styles are pretty barebones, only the required ones are implemented, which keeps things light. You can use your own styles on top of what is here to make it look how you want it to.
    </div>
    <div class="six columns">
        In larger browser windows, the menu items are shown horizontally. In smaller browser windows, menu items are hidden until the 'Menu' is clicked. To see this in action, try resizing the width of your browser and observe the topmost menu bar.

<h4>Why?</h4>
<div class="row">
    <div class="six columns">
    While there are other responsive navigation menus available, most of them require JavaScript to function. This one doesn't.
