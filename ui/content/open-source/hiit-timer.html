            Quick implementation of a configurable timer for HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) or similar workout. I've successfully used this on a desktop and Android browser.

            HIIT workouts require exercises to be performed in succession, without taking breaks in between. There's hardly any room to start and stop a timer in between exercises. With this app, the user can specify a set of exercises and a time interval to perform each exercise. Once the timer starts, each exercise will be displayed for the specified time interval - without the need to manually start/stop the timer for each exercise.
