<h5>Why?</h5>
<div class="row">
    <div class="six columns">
        While there are other notepad/editor apps available, many of them save files to the cloud or in their own format. This one doesn't. Saving to the cloud is not ideal if the user has a limited network. Saving in their own format may not be open and may require special software which limits sharing across devices.
