<h3><a name="skils">Android</a></h3>
<p>
  A responsive navigation menu written in CSS, no JavaScript used. The styles are pretty barebones, only the required ones are implemented, which keeps things light. You can use your own styles on top of what is here to make it look how you want it to.

<h3><a name="interests">Windows Phone</a></h3>
<p>
  While there are other responsive navigation menus available, most of them require JavaScript to function. This one doesn't.
